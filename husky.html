<h1>Husky</h1>
<pre>
<p>
Affectionate and good natured describes the 
Siberian Husky. Generally, they do well with
children although young children should never
be left alone with any breed. They also get
along with people and do well in homes with multiple
dogs. Siberian Huskies were bred to need 
very little food to survive.
<br><br>
It is easy to see why many are drawn to the 
Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but beware because
this athletic, intelligent dog can act independently
and challenge first-time dog parents. Huskies also put
the “H” in Houdini and need a yard with a high fence that
goes all the way into the ground to prevent escapes.
Giving your Husky enough exercise may prove easier
said than done; though, it’ll reduce boredom and 
unwanted behaviors, like escape attempts.
