<h1>Information</h1>
<pre>
<p>
The golden retriever is even-tempered,
intelligent and affectionate. Golden 
retrievers are playful, yet gentle
with children, and they tend to get
along well with other pets and strangers....
Golden retrievers are not often barkers,
and they lack guard instincts, so do not
count on them to make good watchdogs.

The Golden Retriever is one of the most
popular dog breeds in the United States.
The breed's friendly, tolerant attitude
makes them great family pets, and their
intelligence makes them highly capable
working dogs. ... These dogs are fairly
easy to train and get along in just about
any home or family.
