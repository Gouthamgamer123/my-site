The Pomeranian is a compact, short-backed,
active toy dog of Nordic descent.
The double coat consists of a short dense
undercoat with a profuse harsh-textured 
longer outer coat. The heavily plumed tail
is one of the characteristics of the breed.
It is set high and lies flat on the back.
<br><br>
Alert and intelligent, Pomeranians are easily
trained and make fine watchdogs and perky pets
for families with children old enough to know 
the difference between a toy dog and a toy.
Poms are active but can be exercised with indoor
play and short walks, so they are content in
both the city and suburbs. They will master tricks
and games with ease, though their favorite activity
is providing laughs and companionship to their special human.

When humans work closely with animals, bonds form. ... 
Although early humans may have first sought to domesticate 
animals as living tools, they surely recognized the other 
benefits of animals as pets that we still see today. Pets 
are comforting companions. They keep us healthy and relieve stress
