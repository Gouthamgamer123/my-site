Whales
</h1>
<p>
Blue whale is the biggest animal ever.It can grow up to 33m (108 feet) long and weights the same as 30 elephants.On land ,such a large animal would collapse 
under its own weight,but the water supports its bulky body.
A whale's size puts off predators,and its blubber helps it to stay warm in polor water

<b>I don't belive it!</b>

Each atum,humpback whales migrate an increadible 5,000 km(3,100 miles) from their feeding grounds around the poles.In winter
they breed and give birth in warmer,shelterd waters.
