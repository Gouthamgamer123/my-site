<h1>Music Is Art</h1>
<h2>Music Is Rythum</h2>
<h3>Music Instrument Is Equal To God</h3>
<p>
Music is a form of art that uses sound 
organised in time. Music is also a form
of entertainment that puts sounds together 
in a way that people like, find interesting
or dance to. Most music includes people singing
with their voices or playing musical instruments,
such as the piano, guitar, drums or violin.
